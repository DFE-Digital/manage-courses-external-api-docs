# Introduction

Welcome to the Kittn API! You can use our API to access Kittn API endpoints, which can get information on various cats, kittens, and breeds in our database.

We have language bindings in Shell, Ruby, Python, and JavaScript! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

This example API documentation page was created with [Slate](https://github.com/lord/slate). Feel free to edit it and use it as a base for your own API's documentation.

# Authorisation

The server expects an API key to be included in a header  for all API requests:

`Authorization: Bearer your_api_key`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>your_api_key</code> with your issued API key.
</aside>


> To authorise, use this code:

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key"
```

# Courses

## Get all courses

```shell
curl "<%= config[:base_api_url] %>/courses"
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key"
```

> The above command returns JSON structured like this:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Fluffums",
    "breed": "calico",
    "fluffiness": 6,
    "cuteness": 7
